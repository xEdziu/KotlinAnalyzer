# Kotlin Analyzer

This is a project for applying to JetBrains Internship 2025 3.0. The task is to write a kotlin program, which will print all public declarations from a Kotlin program/library sources.

## My journey through this project

[15.03.2025]

In the beginning, I would like to emphasize that I have almost no experience working with Kotlin.
I have been working with Java for a long regarding mobile applications and now, during my 6th semester on Uni, I am trying to switch from Java to Kotlin while developing mobile apps.

It seems very easy to switch from Java to Kotlin, so we will see where it will go :)
